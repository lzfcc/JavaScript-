## 1.3 What's ``this``?
We said earlier that ``this`` is **not an author-time binding but a runtime binding**. It is contextual based on the conditions of the function’s invocation. ``this`` binding has nothing to do with where a function is declared, but has instead everything to do with the manner in which the function is called.
When a function is invoked, an *activation record*, otherwise known as an *execution context*, is created. ``this`` record contains information about where the function was called from (the call-stack), how the function was invoked, what parameters were passed, etc. One of the properties of ``this`` record is the ``this`` reference, which will be used for the duration of that function’s execution.
[之前我们说过 ``this`` 是在运行时进行绑定的，并不是在编写时绑定，它的上下文取决于函数调用时的各种条件。``this`` 的绑定和函数声明的位置无关，只取决于函数的调用方式。
当一个函数被调用时，会创建一个活动记录（有时候也称为执行上下文）。这个记录会包含函数在哪里被调用（调用栈）、函数的调用方法、传入的参数等信息。``this`` 就是记录的其中一个属性，会在函数执行的过程中用到。]

## Scope & Clousure, Appendix A: Dynamic Scope
> To be clear, JavaScript does not, in fact, have dynamic scope. It has lexical scope. Plain and simple. But the ``this`` mechanism is kind of like dynamic scope.

## Appendix C: Lexical ``this``

> The so-called "fat arrow" is often mentioned as a shorthand for the tediously[沉闷的] verbose[冗长的] (sarcasm[讽刺]) ``function`` keyword. 
>But there’s something much more important going on with arrow functions that has nothing to do with saving keystrokes in your declaration. Briefly, this code suffers a problem:
```javascript
var obj = {
    id: "awesome",
    cool: function coolFn() {
        console.log( this.id );
    }
};
var id = "not awesome"
obj.cool(); // awesome
setTimeout( obj.cool, 100 ); // not awesome
```
**The problem is the loss of this binding on the ``cool()`` function**. There are various ways to address that problem, but one often-repeated solution is ``var self = this;``.
That might look like:
```javascript
var obj = {
    count: 0,
    cool: function coolFn() {
        var self = this;
        if (self.count < 1) {
            setTimeout( function timer(){
                self.count++;
                console.log( "awesome?" );
            }, 100 );
        }
    }  
};
obj.cool(); // awesome?
```
``self`` becomes just an identifier that can be resolved via lexical scope and closure, and cares not what happened to the ``this`` binding along the way.
The ES6 solution, the arrow function, introduces a behavior called lexical ``this``.
```javascript
var obj = {
    count: 0,
    cool: function coolFn() {
        if (this.count < 1) {
            setTimeout( () => {
                this.count++;
                console.log( "awesome?" );
            }, 100 );
        }
    }
};
obj.cool(); // awesome?
```
The short explanation is that arrow functions do not behave at all like normal functions when it comes to their this binding. They discard all the normal rules for ``this`` binding, and **instead take on the ``this`` value of their immediate lexical enclosing scope**, whatever it is.
So, in that snippet, the arrow function doesn’t get its ``this`` unbound in
some unpredictable way, **it just "inherits" the ``this`` binding of the ``cool()`` function.
While this makes for shorter code, my perspective is that arrow functions are really just **codifying[编成法典] into the language syntax a common mistake of developers, which is to confuse and conflate[合并] ``this`` binding rules with lexical scope rules**.[尽管这样可以少写一些代码，我认为箭头函数就是将开发者们经常犯的一个错误给标准化了，即混淆了``this``绑定规则和词法作用域规则。（因此作者并不赞同这种做法）]
A more appropriate approach, in my perspective, to this “problem,” is to use and embrace the this mechanism correctly.

```javascript
var obj = {
    count: 0,
    cool: function coolFn() {
        if (this.count < 1) {
            setTimeout( function timer(){
                this.count++; // `this` is safe because of `bind(..)`
                console.log( "more awesome" );
            }.bind( this ), 100 ); // look, `bind()`!
        }
    }
};
obj.cool(); // more awesome
```
