## 6.9 Serializing Objects
![](6.9-1.png)

Note that this code presents a simple way of deep copying an object, using which, however, may cause some underlying mistakes.
```javascript
var obj = {a: NaN, b: false, c: undefined, d: null, e: ''};
var copy = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(obj)); //{a: null, b: false, d: null, e: ''}
```

> The Object.assign() method is used to copy the values of all **enumerable own properties** from one or more source objects to a target object. It will return the target object.
> For deep cloning, we need to use other alternatives. This is because Object.assign() copies the property reference when the property being assigned is an object.
