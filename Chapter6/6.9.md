## 6.9 Serializing Objects
![](6.9-1.png)
Note that this code presents a way of deep copying an object.
> The Object.assign() method is used to copy the values of all **enumerable own properties** from one or more source objects to a target object. It will return the target object.
> For deep cloning, we need to use other alternatives. This is because Object.assign() copies the property reference when the property being assigned is an object.
